Choosing cv Based on Dataset Size:**\n","* For small datasets (<100 samples), a higher value of cv is generally preferred. A common choice is Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV), where cv is equal to the number of samples. However, this can be computationally expensive.\n","\n","* For Moderate-Sized datasets (=<10k samples), a 5-fold or 10-fold cross-validation (cv=5 or cv=10) is commonly used. This strikes a good balance between bias and variance in the model evaluation.\n","\n","* For large datasets (>10k samples), even 3-fold or 5-fold cross-validation (cv=3 or cv=5) can be sufficient, as the large size already offers a robust estimate of model performance.\n","\n","**2. Variance and Stability:**\n","* High Variance in Data: If your data has high variability or noise, using a higher cv (e.g., 10-fold) can give a more stable estimate of the model's performance.\n","\n","* Low Variance in Data: For more homogeneous data, a lower cv (e.g., 3-fold or 5-fold) might be adequate and less computationally intensive.\n","\n","**3. Typical Recommendations:**\n","* A standard starting point for most cases is 5-fold (cv=5) or 10-fold (cv=10) cross-validation. These values provide a good balance between computational cost and providing a robust estimate of the model's performance.\n","\n","* When in Doubt: Use 10-fold cross-validation (cv=10), as it is a widely accepted standard for a variety of datasets and often yields reliable results."],"metadata":{"id":"BsBIoyLijDdS"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"f988c819-6318-4ebe-a862-f5375a54adaa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727356012499,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":385,"user":{"displayName":"jk466 jk466","userId":"12516856744640099968"}},"outputId":"b39886f6-1f65-433f-e8ac-3043a8c0b1ef"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The mean R^2 of the folds is -0.161, and the standard deviation is 0.385\n"]}],"source":["# Results from cross validation\n","Rcv = cross_val_score(lre, x_data[['CPU_frequency']], y_data, cv=4)\n","print(f\"The mean R^2 of the folds is {Rcv.mean():.3f}, and the standard deviation is {Rcv.std():.3f}\")"],"execution_count":26},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"174db870-f716-493a-b895-0ccd2323126c"},"source":["<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>\n","\n","```python\n","Rcross = cross_val_score(lre, x_data[['CPU_frequency']], y_data, cv=4)\n","print(\"The mean of the folds are\", Rcross.mean(), \"and the standard deviation is\" , Rcross.std())\n","```\n","\n","</details>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"38462969-28fa-48cb-9c64-0eb7e109904d"},"source":["# Task 2: Overfitting\n","\n","Split the data set into training and testing components again, this time reserving 50% of the data set for testing.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"40022c03-e51c-4486-86a7-d7c5dd6bde0d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727358191253,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":434,"user":{"displayName":"jk466 jk466","userId":"12516856744640099968"}},"outputId":"20a838f5-cd82-464d-c6f4-5afba78f29d6"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["number of test samples : 119\n","number of training samples: 119\n"]}],"source":["# fixing random_state to a fixed quantity helps maintain uniformity between multiple\n","x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x_data, y_data, test_size=0.50, random_state=0)\n","print(\"number of test samples :\", x_test.shape[0])\n","print(\"number of training samples:\",x_train.shape[0])"],"execution_count":28},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"c5634ab3-e408-4f07-b916-0b8c5be7943c"},"source":["<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>\n","\n","```python\n","x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x_data, y_data, test_size=0.5, random_state=0)\n","# fixing random_state to a fixed quantity helps maintain uniformity between multiple\n","# executions of the code.\n","```\n","\n","</details>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0abac62e-23e1-4c19-bb9e-02b559c976f8"},"source":["To identify the point of overfitting the model on the parameter \"CPU_frequency\", you'll need to create polynomial features using the single attribute.\n","You need to evaluate the R^2 scores of the model created using different degrees of polynomial features, ranging from 1 to 5.
